            the world. Cats have taken the form of gods, supernatural creatures,
            familiars, and much more. Throughout history cats have been given

            Historically, cats weren't kept as pets and fed by loving owners.
            They had to provide for themselves and hunt for their own food, like
            their big cat cousins such as lions and tigers. A limited amount of
            prey meant that only the most successful hunters survived and
            reproduced, so your four-legged friend is descended from
            hunting-savvy cat ancestors.
